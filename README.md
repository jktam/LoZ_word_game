# The Legend of Zelda: Word Game

Have you ever been told by an old man that it was dangerous to go alone and received an incredibly sharp object to combat the forces of evil? Well, the old man probably wanted you to leave his cave so he can go back to playing this game. This is a Legend of Zelda inspired hangman game, where the goal to guess as many words as you can to acquire more rupees. Will you rise up to the challenge and defeat the evil known as words?

Press the Link (hah.) here to being your quest: https://raywhui.github.io/Hangman-Game/


## How to Play

You probably don't need any items for this quest. Just a general knowledge of Zelda will be fine. A fairy would help if you mess up. You get 5 hearts and you lose 1 everytime you guess the letter wrong. If you fail to guess the word, you are DEAD! But succeed, and you will be granted a single rupee. The cycle repeats it self again, kinda like how the series work.
